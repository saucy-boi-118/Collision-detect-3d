# What Is This Project 
This project is a half-working 3D collision detector written in the C Language with pointers and help from Microsoft Copilot. It consists of a 3D cube and platform and detects the possible collisions between them. This is written by an inexperienced code so don't plan on fully trusting it for large scale projects. It's written in Raylib and game library with no game engine. I am an inexperienced coder so mistakes or bugs will be an issue
# What it does
It checks the collisions between an object and a platform 
# How to run it
Download Raylib with NotePad++ and follow instructions
# Why it exists
I was bored and decided to make my own collision detection instead of using pre made ones
